Total hours so far: 3

- [x] I have access to a 3D printer (printing-leigon)

BOM: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OtqszPI16ybW3s_6Pz4gcUsUTPw2b_rEn2WlHAjkEtA/

## DAY ONE // 18th March
- I'm new to this so I did a ton of research today :D. I have gained an understanding of mechanisms, and feel much more confident now!
- Research time: 1 hour

## DAY TWO // 19th March
- Curated the BOM today, and I have a vision of what I want my printer to have:
- Should have USBC, Portable, size perhaps 55 x 55 x 55, Battery powered (obvio). Preferably but not compulsorily wireless
- Since this is going to be portable, the hotbed should have a firmer grip.
Time spent: approximately. 30 mins

## DAY THREE // 21st March
- I need to lock in for the next ten days now.
- Im making the BOM in google docs now, and the parts I found out earlier are now out of stock/very low stock, so I'll make a BOM from novo3d.in
- Also, I have decided to make a slightly different kind of printer, new requirements:
    - USBC, WiFi/BLE compatibility
    - Should be fast
    - It should continue printing right where it left off in case of power outage
    - Should have a camera and software to create good timelapses
    - It will also have a grid of neopixels to indicate the progress
    - It will have a touch display which can show contols, progress (in time) and estimated time remaining.
    - The camera should be able to stream the progess if requested by user wirelessly.
 
- Time spent: 30 mins

## DAY FOUR // 22nd March
- Got a lot of progress on the BOM, now I can start working on CAD
- I need to watch a tutorial on FreeCAD
- I also got another insane idea: what if the printer could make filament out of random plastic pieces?
- Time spent: 2.5 hours

## DAY FIVE // 23rd March 
- Yesterday night, while racking my brain, I decided to make a bedslinger instead of X and Y axes being controlled by the printhead.
- X and Z axes will be controlled by the printhead, Y will be controlled by the heatbed. 
- X and Y to be controlled with belt and Z will be controlled by lead screws.
- Another idea: I have found a yt video to directly print plastic shreds instead of making filament first. For this, the printhead has an extension on top of it (like a hat).
- However this modified printhead will not be able to print filament. To solve this problem, I will have two printheads, which can be swapped magnetically.
- The bracket which is controlled by the belt will have neodymium magnets embedded. the swappable printheads too will have magnets embedded.

- I found this resource: https://www.instructables.com/DIY-3D-Printer-From-Scratch/ which has helped me a TON! Everything just got a who lot easier, because I had so many misconceptions regarding the structure and mechanisms.
- I will be ditching the linear rails entirely and use smooth rods.
- Also, my old bracket for the belt was supposed to be attached to the belt using grooves, but watching a video, I can just attach it using a ziptie.
- Also, I will now be using open belts instead of closed ones, which is a good thing, because I couldn't find an appropriate size for the belt.
