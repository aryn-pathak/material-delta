## DAY ONE // 18th March
- I'm new to this so I did a ton of research today :D. I have gained an understanding of mechanisms, and feel much more confident now!
- Research time: 1 hour

## DAY TWO // 19th March
- Curated the BOM today, and I have a vision of what I want my printer to have:
- Should have USBC, Portable, size perhaps 55 x 55 x 55, Battery powered (obvio). Preferably but not compulsorily wireless
- Since this is going to be portable, the hotbed should have a firmer grip.
