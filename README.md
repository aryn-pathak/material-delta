# MATERIAL DELTA (stylised as mÎ´)
## Concept:
**"What if a printer was 3D printed?"** _thats called a reprap printer, nothing new, duh!_

**"Alright, what if it was super cheap, about $150?"** _Impressive, but it's probably super small, super slow, and super low quality too. why not splurge the $350 limit you have!_

**"Nope, what if it was ultra fast too?"** _powerful motors and a 100W hotend, nothing special either-- probably eats up a TON of power!_

**"Can't you ever be happy?! Fine, what if it was powered by USBC?"** _you're kidding thats not possible blah blah blah about how a 3D printer can't be powered by USBC_

The Material DELTA is an opensource delta style 3D printer, built for speed, pockets, and powered by USBC


Huge huge huge thanks to Hack Club and Alex (the organizer of this ysws) for making this possible :D
