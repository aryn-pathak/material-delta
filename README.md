# MATERIAL ZERO
## An open source, well documented 3D printer, designed w/ ❤️ by aryan

This is Material ZERO (zero for being the zero-th version of a printer that will be heavily modified to make better versions down the line.), A printer that is easy to modify, upgrade, and most importantly-- to use.
- Features a truly hands free experience for printing; simply uploading an stl file on the web interface and choosing a preset (fast, hi-res, fast with supports, or hi-res with supports). That's it: slicing, supports, settings, ABL, all handled by Material.)
- The printer also features a magnetic printhead (with wiring!), so swapping out toolheads is just a click of neodyium magnets away!

Huge huge huge thanks to Hack Club and Alex (the organizer of this ysws) for making this possible :D
