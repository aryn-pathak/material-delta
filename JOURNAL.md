## DAY ONE // 18th March
- I'm new to this so I did a ton of research today :D. I have gained an understanding of mechanisms, and feel much more confident now!
- Research time: 1 hour

## DAY TWO // 19th March
- Curated the BOM today, and I have a vision of what I want my printer to have:
- Should have USBC, Portable, size perhaps 55 x 55 x 55, Battery powered (obvio). Preferably but not compulsorily wireless
- Since this is going to be portable, the hotbed should have a firmer grip.
Time spent: approximately. 30 mins

# DAY THREE // 21st March
- I need to lock in for the next ten days now.
- Im making the BOM in google docs now, and the parts I found out earlier are now out of stock/very low stock, so I'll make a BOM from novo3d.in
- Also, I have decided to make a slightly different kind of printer, new requirements:
    - USBC, WiFi/BLE compatibility
    - Should be fast
    - It should continue printing right where it left off in case of power outage
    - Should have a camera and software to create good timelapses
    - It will also have a grid of neopixels to indicate the progress
    - It will have a touch display which can show contols, progress (in time) and estimated time remaining.
    - The camera should be able to stream the progess if requested by user wirelessly.
 
- I'm hoping to get started on CAD today
