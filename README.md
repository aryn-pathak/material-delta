# MATERIAL DELTA (stylised as mÎ´)
## Concept:
**"What if a printer was 3D printed?"** _thats called a reprap printer, nothing new, duh!_

**"Alright, what if it was super cheap, about $150?"** _Impressive, but it's probably super small, super slow, and super low quality too. why not splurge the $350 limit you have!_

**"Nope, what if it was ultra fast too?"** _powerful motors and a 100W hotend, nothing special either-- probably eats up a TON of power!_

**"Can't you ever be happy?! Fine, what if it was powered by USBC?"** _you're kidding thats not possible blah blah blah about how a 3D printer can't be powered by USBC_

The Material DELTA is an opensource delta style 3D printer, built for speed, pockets, and powered by USBC, powered by a RPi Zero 2W running klipper, with raspberry pi pico controlling motors for high speed motion.
